# How to update roles assigned on verification
Upon verification, Whodis gives users the "Member" role and the "Signups 23/24" role (or equivalent). this role needs to be updated at the start of every academic year.

## Create a new signups role

## Re-run the Whodis setup command
- you will need to be a server admin for this
1. go to the \#registration channel
2. re-run the /setup command to update the roles assigned upon verification
   `/setup announce-channel: #welcome logging-channel: #moderators given-role-1: @Member given-role-2: @Signups 2023/2024`
3. delete any previous messages from whodis in the \#registration channel
