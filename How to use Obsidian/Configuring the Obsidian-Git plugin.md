#TODO migrate this repo to UCCNetsoc account and write docs on how to configure keys for ssh access
- this repo should ideally be private

as of right now I have a private repo on my own github (git@github.com:colmmurphyxyz/Netsoc-Sysadmin-Resources.git) and have the git plugin configured to automatically commit and push changes regularly, and pull changes from the remote on startup. the push functionality doesn't work due to "bad config" although pushing from the command line works fine
